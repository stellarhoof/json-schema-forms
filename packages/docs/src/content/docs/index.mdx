# Notes

This library replaces native [constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Constraint_validation)

- Do not set [validation attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Constraint_validation#validation-related_attributes) on controls

In practice a form schema will be different from a collection schema:

- Collection schemas are immutable, whereas form schemas are mutable
- Form schemas may be a subset of collection schema. Ex: email/name/password
  fields from a user collection.
- Form schemas may be a composition of different collection schemas. Ex: export
  fields + saved search fields
- Form schemas may have fields that are not present in any collection schema and
  that are used to do computation at submit time.
- Fields in form schemas may have dependencies among themselves that were not
  present in the collection schemas and viceversa
- Fields in the collection schemas may have dependencies among themselves that
  do not make sense in the form schema
- Fields in the collection schemas may be overriden in the form schema

# How to use

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { ChakraProvider, extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { FormComponentsProvider } from '@json-schema-forms/react'
import { theme, layouts, controls } from '@json-schema-forms/chakra-mobx'

function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={extendTheme(theme)}>
      <FormComponentsProvider layouts={layouts} controls={controls}>
        <TheRestOfYourApplication />
      </LayoutsProvider>
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

# TODO

- Check out https://json-schema-forms.vercel.app/
- Convert string to type in RadioGroup
- Convert string to type in Select
- Make a util to extract a subschema based off fields to omit/pick
  - Use JSON pointers for pick/omit keys. Users can make a util to shorten the json pointers if they want.
  - Schema should be normalized (disallow `$refs` and `$defs`)
  - Recurse into schema composition keywords `allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, and `not`
  - Recurse into subschema application keywords `dependentRequired`, `dependentSchemas`, and `if-then-else`
